## Goal

The goal of this project was to create a professional portfolio that showcases my skills and expertise in UX and UI design. The site should be easy to use, visually appealing, and provide a clear overview of my work and experience.

## Strategy

The strategy for this project was to create a site that is both visually appealing and user-friendly. To achieve this, I followed a user-centered design approach that focused on understanding the needs and expectations of my target audience. I conducted research on existing portfolios and analyzed user feedback to identify the key features and elements that would make my site stand out.
